    <hr class = "break">

    <p class = "text"> &emsp;&emsp; My goal as a Regional Officer would be to improve communication both within and between chapters. In order to do this, I would like to implement various ideas to allow more information to be shared between members so that they may have the best TSA experience possible.</p>

    <p class = "text"> &emsp;&emsp; For example, for newer members, selecting competitions may actually be a disappointing process. I myself recall looking at the long event list and feeling dismayed at the fact that I did not have the skills or knowledge to participate in many of the competitions offered. In order to address this, as a regional officer, I would implement a form system wherein skilled upperclassmen and newer members of TSA could submit their contacts in order to be connected, allowing the more experienced member to teach the less experienced. </p>

    <p class = "text"> &emsp;&emsp; I would also like to improve communication between competition administrators and competitors. It seems that at almost every conference, an event is delayed, a schedule is changed, or something along those lines. I would like to propose a requirement for all delays or changes to be posted to a widely visible notice board at the competition. I would also like to advocate for more communication between competition administrators and host officers in order to increase the likelihood of the news getting out.</p>

    <p class = "text"> &emsp;&emsp; Overall, my goal is simply to do my part in helping OKTSA be the best it can be.</p>
